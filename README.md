The following is a list of tables used in the backend api:

Tables and Columns

User Table - with columns user_id, email address, etc. as set up in the Rails template

Profile Table - with columns profile_id (generated by Rails), user_name, about_me

Concert Table - with columns concert_id (generated by Rails), event_name, date, time, artist, venue, venue_address, cost

Profile_Follow Join Table with columns profile_follows_id (generated by Rails), profile_id, followed_id (which is a profile_id)

Profile_Concert Join Table with columns profile_concert_id (generated by Rails), concert_id, profile_id

Note: I used the following website to help with setting up a 'friends' relationship among profile users -- http://railscasts.com/episodes/163-self-referential-association?view=asciicast


In a future release, additional table for Venue and Artist will be created.

ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another (one to many, many to many, etc).

``` User Table    -|-----<   A profile has one user ```

``` Concert Table ->------<- A profile has many concerts; A concert has many profiles ```

``` Profile Table ->------<- Profile_Follow Join Table ```
``` A profile has many profile_followers and a profile_follower has many profiles```

``` Profile Table ->------<- Profile_Concert Join Table ```
``` A profile has many concerts and a concert has many profiles```


## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

  post '/sign-up' => 'users#signup'
  post '/sign-in' => 'users#signin'
  delete '/sign-out/:id' => 'users#signout'
  patch '/change-password/:id' => 'users#changepw'

  resources :profiles, except: [:new, :edit]
  ???? for :profiles no index??
